## About
covid-maps is a web map application project that uses data about COVID-19 in 2020 to visualize two different interactive web maps.
## Maps
### COVID-19 Rates by US County 2020

## Data
The data for the first map comes from [ACS](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US%24050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true) and it contains information on estimated population data at the county level.  Combining this information with the COVID-19 cases data from [The New York Times](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) and we were able to calculate the estimated rates per 100,000 residents of a county.  The US county shapefile comes from the [US Census Bereau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)
